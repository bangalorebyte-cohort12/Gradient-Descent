# Gradient-Descent-

Excercise: Write a function implementing Stochastic Gradient Descent but which does not need an epochs input. It uses some threshold value to decide when to stop coverging. Compare the run-time of the SGD function with my Batch Gradient Descent function.

Generate a million random datapoints to test the functions by looking at the Numpy documentation for random.normal()
